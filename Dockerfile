# NOTE: If you don't run the mkdir -p /usr/share/man/man1 /usr/share/man/man2 you'll run into dependency problems with ca-certificates, 
# openjdk-11-jre-headless etc. 
# I've been using this fix provided by community, haven't really checked the permanent fix.

# culr (optional) for downloading/browsing stuff
# openssh-client (required) for creating ssh tunnel
# psmisc (optional) I needed it to test port binding after ssh tunnel (eg: netstat -ntlp | grep 6443)
# nano (required) buster-slim doesn't even have less. so I needed an editor to view/edit file (eg: /etc/hosts)
